## Objective
*A detailed explanation of the project. What problem does it solve? What are the goals and success criteria?*

## Tech Stack
*A list of the key technologies, libraries, and frameworks used.*
- **Language:** Python 3.11
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, PyTorch
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook, VS Code
- **Other:** ROS, Gazebo

## Installation
*Provide clear, step-by-step instructions on how to get your project set up and running.*
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git)
cd your-project-name

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install the required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage
# Explain how to run your code and use the project. Include code blocks with example commands.

## Bash
# To run the main analysis script:
# Example: python src/main.py

## Key Learnings
# A reflective section. What were the main challenges? What new concepts or techniques did you learn? This is # very important for recruiters.
# Examples:
# Challenge: Ingesting and cleaning the sensor data proved difficult due to inconsistent timestamps.
# Solution: I implemented a resampling algorithm using Pandas to normalize the data.
# New Skill: Learned how to fine-tune a pre-trained CNN model using PyTorch.

## Next Steps
# What are the future plans for this project? What features would you add next?
# Examples:
# [ ] Implement a web interface using Streamlit.
# [ ] Refactor the data processing pipeline for better performance.
# [ ] Deploy the model as a cloud service.
